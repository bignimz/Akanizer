2. If the gender selected is Male, then the function checks the male names array and output the name based on the day index of the male names array.
2. If the gender selected is Female, then the function checks the female names array and output the name based on the day index of the male names array.
3. Then the Akan name of a user is displayed on the html document of the application.
